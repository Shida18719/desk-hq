## Manual Testing

* ### User Story Testing


| Expectations                                                                                 | How are they achieved?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Automated Testing

### Python Unit Tests

This project uses the [Djangoâ€™s unit tests](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/testing/overview/).

* Djangoâ€™s unit tests use a Python standard library module: unittest. This module defines tests using a class-based approach.

* The tests solely rely on database access such as creating or querying the models. Hence, the test were created using 'test classes' as subclasses of django.test.TestCase rather than unittest.TestCase. Leading to unit tests that pass when run in isolation but fail when run in a suite.

* It does not require any additional dependencies to run. 

 * `python3 manage.py test `

 * To see a coverage report use the command: ` coverage run --source='.' manage.py test `

 * `coverage report` : Specify the path to the file after the command to see a report on the particular file or group of files. 

 * `coverage html` 

* `Python3 â€“m http.server` : to view coverage 

Find the coverage report screenshots image below.

### **Lighthouse**

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

However, my google cloud platform free trial is over within the time of finishing this project. This caused a permanent error flagged in the console therefore affected the 'Best Practice' score in the Chrome Developer Tools. Please see the expandable click;

## Bugs

**Solved Bugs** 


| No | Bug | How I solved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | After creating the Location Models and linking it with the Booking Models as it's ForiegnKey, I made a migration, an error "You are trying to add a non-nullable field <field> to <model> without a default; we can't do that (the database needs something to populate existing rows). Please select a fix:" <br>1. Provide a one-off default now (will be set on all existing rows with a null value for this column) <br>2. Quit, and let me add a default in models.py | An option '2', was selected from the given options, where I added a default placeholder to the location model. Then a different error popped up. `Value Error: Field 'id expected but got ''`. The was fixed by creating an 'id' with a `primary_key` value of `True` for location models. |
| 2 | When the Services page template was created, I did not make it dynamic and also I didn't add the content to the admin panel right after creating the template, causing a `Programming Error at desk_service`. Where only the Sqlite (local host) has the template view, while the  postgreSQL database(ElephantSQL) was unable to find the content. | I use the `dumpdata command` to input the content into the postgreSQL database(ElephantSQL), then reran migration: `python3 manage.py dumpdata app.modelsName > modelsName.json` The dumpdata command can be used to generate input for loaddata (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/django-admin/#dumpdata). |
| 3 | A TemplateSyntax Error at /Service/.  ![for loop counter](./READMEimages/service-bug.png). Using the for loop Django syntax wrongly to loop through the services page images and content dynamically. | Django doesn't accept a `modulo` operator. The `divisibleby` fixed the error - {% if not forloop.counter|divisibleby:2 %}. |
| 4 | Bootstrap Flash messages error from Javascript. `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'defaultPrevented')` . | When I inspected the error message from inside the Chrome DevTools console, a suggestion pointing to use Jquery was found. I included a Jquery script link and the alert class: `$('.alert').delay(3500).fadeOut(1000);` to fix the bug. |



**Known Bugs** 

| Bug | Known Bug |
| :--- | :--- |
| Google Map Billing Error displayed in the console. | The free trial ended so, has affected the 'Best Practice' score for all pages in the lighthouse. |
