## Automated Testing

### Python Unit Tests

This project uses the [Djangoâ€™s unit tests](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/testing/overview/).

* Djangoâ€™s unit tests use a Python standard library module: unittest. This module defines tests using a class-based approach.

* The tests solely rely on database access such as creating or querying the models. Hence, the test were created using 'test classes' as subclasses of django.test.TestCase rather than unittest.TestCase. Leading to unit tests that pass when run in isolation but fail when run in a suite.
